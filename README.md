  Grafana Palindrome.js Panel
</h1>

Visualize Prometheus metrics or other datasources in 3D with the Grafana Palindrome.js panel. This panel is based over the SMILE [Palindrome.js](https://github.com/Smile-SA/palindrome.js/) library.

> Palindrome.js is a three.js based library which provides 3D monitoring for system metrics and KPIs. Metrics are presented as sets within layers, which helps to easily identify relations between metrics, indicators, behaviors or trends for your realtime systems or any other data source. Custom algorithms, visual behaviors, styles and color schemes can easily be modified or added.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting started

### Install dependencies and build the project

   ```bash
   docker build -t palindrome-builder .
   docker run -v ./dist:/dist palindrome-builder
   ```

### Run the plugin

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
   - Project should be up and running on: http://localhost:3000.
   - Grafana credentials: (username: admin, password: admin)
   - On the main dashboard you should be able to see three Palindrome.js panels with InfluxDB, Prometheus, and Graphite data sources.

### Run the E2E tests (using Cypress)

   ```bash
   # Spins up a Grafana instance first that we tests against
   docker compose up

   # Starts the tests
   npm run e2e
   ```

### Run the linter

   ```bash
   npm run lint

   # or

   npm run lint:fix
   ```

## üéØ Features and usage
Palindrome.js is composed of layers defined by the user. Each layer can contain from 1 to *n* metrics. Metrics ranges are described through minimum, median, and maximum values, which are inputs from the user. The current value is obtained from the time series database. The overall Palindrome.js shape and color reflect the current values evolving in their user described ranges. For further details, please refer to the Palindrome.js [documentation](https://github.com/Smile-SA/palindrome.js/wiki).

This panel should be connected to one of these supported data sources:
- Prometheus
- InfluxDB v2
- Graphite

Once done, you can define layers and metrics using code queries, following this format:

```
<query> <comment-sign>label: <label>, layer: <layerName>, ranges: [<min value>, <med value>, <max value>]
```
**Notes:**
- Palindrome.js metadata should be inside a comment section.
- Comment signs can be `#` or `//`.
- `label` metadata is optional

**Example for Prometheus data source**:

  ```Promql
  node_disk_io_now{device="nvme0n1"} #label: ssdMetric, layer: systemMetrics, ranges: [0, 50, 100]
  ```

- Once you've finished typing queries, click on `Run queries`, and the 3D object will appear. 

**Example for InfluxDB v2 data source**:

```Flux
from(bucket: "Palindrome.js")
  |> range(start:-1m)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "cpu")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_field"] == "usage_system")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r["cpu"] == "cpu0")
  //layer: Container Metrics, ranges: [0, 3, 10]
```

**Example for Graphite data source**:
```
carbon.agents.*-a.pointsPerUpdate #layer: layer2, ranges: [0, 1, 3]
```


After setting up queries, two fields will be populated: `Palindrome Data Structure` and `Palindrome Configuration`:

  - **Palindrome Data Structure:** This is the data structure of Palindrome.js based on the metrics entered by the user. It is a read-only text area (editable through query comments).

  - **Palindrome Configuration:** This field displays the current configuration used to display the 3D object. It is editable. For more information, please refer to our [API reference](https://github.com/Smile-SA/palindrome.js/wiki/API-Reference).
